# Fourier Transform course

This repository contains material for an interactive course on Fourier transform (FT).
You can find many documents on the FT, (for instance [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform), usually full of good theory, and with some examples.

The idea here is to emphasize  *exploration* and *feeling* of the FT rather than on theory.
For this I use jupyter notebook interactivity to display the basis of FT.
The emphasis is set on spectroscopy (my main topic) rather than image processing or cristallography.
