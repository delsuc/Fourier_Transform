    "**Real** numbers are *regular* numbers, going from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ through every number you might want to use. They are said to belong to $\\mathbb{R}$, the set of all real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$ can be seen as a line, going from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Reals are on a line, **Complex** numbers are on a plane. \n",
    "As any plane, the coordinates are defined on two axes, the horizontal axis is the $\\mathbb{R}$ line, the vertical one is the *Imaginary* axis, also holding real numbers, and labeled with $i$.\n",
    "This plane is called $\\mathbb{C}$ the complex plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A complex number $z$ (a point in this plane) is thus described with two numbers, $a$ and $b$: $$z = a +ib$$\n",

    "The position of the complex point $z$ can also be described by its *module* (the distance to the center)\n",

    "Fourier transform (or **FT**) is defined as a transformation of *continuous functions* $f$ from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$), they have to be integrable over $]-\\infty ... \\infty[$, and can be extended to the limit to *distributions* which somehow drops this later condition.\n",

    "What we're doing here is very different, it is another transform, called digital Fourier transform (or **DFT**), perfectly defined in mathematical terms, but very different in its form, that applies to finite series of values $y_k$.\n",
    "DFT applies in the computer, were we are going to compute of *vectors* of values `x[k]` as a representation of the series $x_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "we do not deal with continuous functions, but rather with series $x[n]$ and $X[k]$, instead of $f$ and $F$.\n",

    "In the computer, DFT transforms thus a vector into another vector, as it is a linear operation, it can be represented by a (usually square) matrix, and would take a burden proportional to $N^2$ to compute for a vector of length $N$.\n",
    "Thanks to Cooley & Tuckey(1) there is an very efficient algorithm that does it in $N \\log_2(N)$ operations provided $N$ is a power of two ($N=2^k$), and which is called Fast Fourier transform (or **FFT**).\n",
